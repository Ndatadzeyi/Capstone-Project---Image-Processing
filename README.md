Create a copy of the MNIST.ipynb file and rename it mnist_task.ipynb.

● Load the MNIST dataset. Use a library such as SKLearn to access the dataset
(from sklearn.datasets import load_digits).

● Split the training data into a training and test set.

○ Add a comment explaining the purpose of the train and test sets

● Use the RandomForestClassifier built into sklearn to create a classification
model.

● Pick one parameter to tune, and explain why you chose this parameter.

● Choose which value for the parameter to set for testing on the test data and
explain why.

● Print the confusion matrix for your Random Forest model on the test set.

● Report which classes the model struggles with the most.

● Report the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score (HINT: use

average=”macro” in precision_score, recall_score and f1_score from sklearn).# Capstone-Project---Image-Processing
